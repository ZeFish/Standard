/**
 * ClientRouter Component
 *
 * Enables Astro View Transitions API for smooth SPA-like navigation
 * between pages without requiring a full page reload.
 *
 * This is the current recommended component for client-side routing.
 * It provides client-side routing with smooth page transitions using
 * the native View Transitions browser API.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Automatic SPA-mode client-side routing
 * - Smooth page transitions with CSS animations
 * - Browser history management (back/forward)
 * - Automatic re-initialization of Standard Framework modules
 * - Theme persistence across transitions
 * - Fallback support for browsers without View Transitions API
 *
 * @see https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/
 *
 * @example
 *   ---
 *   import { ClientRouter } from 'astro:transitions';
 *   ---
 *   <head>
 *     <ClientRouter />
 *   </head>
 *
 * @example With custom fallback
 *   <ClientRouter fallback="swap" />
