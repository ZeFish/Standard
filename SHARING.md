üé® **Introducing Standard: Fine-Art Typography for the Web**

I'm excited to share my latest project - a typography framework that brings centuries-old print design wisdom to modern web development.

**What makes Standard special:**

üî¢ **Mathematical Precision**: Built on the golden ratio (œÜ = 1.618) and its derivatives for harmonious proportions

üìê **Swiss Design Heritage**: 12-column grid system inspired by Swiss typography masters like Jan Tschichold

üñãÔ∏è **Micro-typography Engine**: JavaScript rules for smart quotes, widow prevention, and punctuation fixes

üé® **Print Design Terminology**: Uses authentic print terms like `.standard`, `.margin`, `.bleed` for semantic layouts

üåà **Perceptual Color**: OKLCH color space for mathematically consistent contrast relationships

‚ö° **Performance Focused**: 29.1kB compressed, optimized for production use

Standard provides the typographic foundation that respects both readability science and aesthetic excellence.

Available now on npm: `@zefish/standard`

Documentation: https://npmjs.com/package/@zefish/standard

**Title:** [Open Source] Standard - Fine-Art Typography Framework with Golden Ratio Precision

Hey r/webdev! üëã

I just released **Standard**, a typography framework that implements classical print design principles for the web. It's been a labor of love combining my interest in both typography history and modern web development.

## What is it?

A CSS/JS framework focused on fine-art typography, mathematical precision, and readability science. Think of it as bringing the wisdom of centuries-old print design to modern web development.

## Key Features:

- **Mathematical ratios** based on the golden ratio (œÜ = 1.618) for harmonious spacing
- **Swiss-style grid system** with semantic utility classes
- **JavaScript micro-typography engine** for smart quotes, widow prevention, etc.
- **Print design terminology** (`.standard`, `.margin`, `.bleed`) for semantic layouts
- **OKLCH color system** for perceptual color consistency
- **Vertical rhythm system** aligned to baseline grid

npm install @zefish/standard

## Why I built this:

Most CSS frameworks focus on components and utilities, but few address the fundamentals of typography and reading experience. I wanted something that respects both the science of readability and the art of classical typography.

The framework uses authentic print design terminology - "standard" actually refers to the space between columns in traditional typography, which felt perfect for a framework about spatial relationships.

- **npm**: https://npmjs.com/package/@zefish/standard

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback! Typography is such a crucial part of web UX that often gets overlooked.

## üîó Hacker News Submission

**Title:** Standard ‚Äì Fine-art typography framework with golden ratio precision

**URL:** https://github.com/ZeFish/Standard

**Comment:**
I built this typography framework to bridge classical print design with modern web development. It implements mathematical ratios based on the golden ratio, Swiss-style grids, and micro-typography rules that CSS can't handle alone.

The name "standard" comes from traditional typography - it's the space between columns, which felt fitting for a framework about spatial relationships and reading flow.

Key technical decisions:
- Uses CSS Custom Properties for mathematical ratio system
- JavaScript engine handles typography rules CSS cannot (smart quotes, widow prevention)
- OKLCH color space for perceptual consistency
- Semantic class names using print terminology

Available on npm as @zefish/standard - would love feedback from the HN community on both the technical approach and typographic philosophy.

**Subject:** Introducing Standard: Typography Framework for Fine-Art Web Design

**Body:**
Fellow developers and designers,

I'm excited to announce the release of **Standard** - a typography framework that brings the precision of classical print design to the web.

After months of research into typography masters like Jan Tschichold and Robert Bringhurst, I've distilled their principles into a modern web framework that focuses on:

‚Ä¢ **Reading Experience**: Optimal line lengths, vertical rhythm, and spacing
‚Ä¢ **Mathematical Harmony**: Golden ratio-based proportions
‚Ä¢ **Semantic Markup**: Print design terminology for meaningful CSS classes
‚Ä¢ **Micro-typography**: JavaScript engine for details CSS can't handle

The framework is now available on npm and ready for production use. Whether you're building blogs, documentation, or content-heavy applications, Standard provides the typographic foundation for exceptional reading experiences.

**Get Started:**
```bash
npm install @zefish/standard
```

**Resources:**
- Documentation: https://npmjs.com/package/@zefish/standard
- Source Code: https://github.com/ZeFish/Standard
- Examples: See the `/example` directory

I'd love to hear how you use it in your projects!

Best regards,
Francis Fontaine
