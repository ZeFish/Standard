# Standard Framework

Standard is built on the belief that design systems should be rooted in centuries of typographic tradition, mathematical precision, and the timeless principles of Swiss International Style.

## Philosophy

Every measurement derives from the golden ratio (φ = 1.618), every layout follows the Swiss grid tradition, and every interaction honors the craft of fine typography.

## Core Features

### Fine-Art Typography Engine
Classical typography rules that CSS cannot handle. Automatic enhancement of text with smart quotes, proper punctuation, em-dashes, fraction formatting, and widow prevention.

### Swiss Grid System
12-column responsive grid inspired by Josef Müller-Brockmann with asymmetric layouts and free column positioning.

### Vertical Rhythm
Bulletproof spacing system where all elements align to a baseline grid using `1rlh` units

### Color System
Automatic light/dark theming with semantic colors and high-contrast support.

### Reading Layout
Editorial-quality layouts optimized for long-form content with multiple width variants.

## Quick Start

Create a new `.md` file in the `content/` directory and it automatically becomes a page on your site.
