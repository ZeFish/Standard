# Foundation

Documentation for foundation components and utilities.

## Components

- [Design Tokens](/docs/design-tokens/) - Primitive design tokens forming the foundation of the design system.
Includes mathematical ratios, modular scales, spacing system, and animation curves.
All tokens use CSS custom properties for runtime customization.
- [SCSS Variables & Mixins](/docs/scss-variables-&-mixins/) - Responsive breakpoints and rhythm application mixins for consistent
vertical rhythm and spacing across all elements. These mixins ensure proper
spacing application for rhythm-aware components.
- [Rhythm Application Mixin](/docs/rhythm-application-mixin/) - Applies rhythm spacing rules to semantic HTML elements
and common layout components. Ensures consistent vertical rhythm.
- [Rhythm Block Mixin](/docs/rhythm-block-mixin/) - Applies enhanced spacing to block-level elements that require
extra visual separation such as callouts, blockquotes, code blocks, and tables.
