# Date Format Normalization

Date Format Normalization - Temporal Metadata Standardization

 Front matter in markdown is notoriously finicky about dates. Write them one way in YAML and they're strings; write them another and they're parsed as JavaScript Date objects. This inconsistency breaks templating, sorting, and filteringâ€”the three pillars of content management.

The YAML 1.1 specification (which Jekyll popularized) tries to be helpful by auto-parsing timestamps. But it's unreliable across systems and configurations. This preprocessor takes the author's intentâ€”a readable timestamp like "2024-10-25 14:30"â€”and guarantees it becomes a proper JavaScript Date object before any templating runs.

It's defensive programming for content: assume strings, validate carefully, transform only when safe, and preserve originals if anything seems wrong. Your dates become predictable, sortable, and reliable throughout the pipeline.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements 
 - [ ] Support timezone specification in timestamps
 - [ ] Add date range parsing for duration fields
 - [ ] Create ISO 8601 validation strictness option

```javascript
eleventyConfig.addPreprocessor("fixDates", "md", (data, content) => {
    const fixDateString = (value) => {
      if (
        typeof value === "string" &&
        /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}/.test(value)
      ) {
        const date = new Date(value.replace(" ", "T"));
        // If the date is invalid, return the original value to prevent errors
        return isNaN(date.getTime()) ? value : date;
      }
      return value;
    };

    // Fix only known fields
    if (data.created) data.created = fixDateString(data.created);
    if (data.modified) data.modified = fixDateString(data.modified);

    return content;
  });
