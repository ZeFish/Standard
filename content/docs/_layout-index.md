# Layout

Documentation for layout components and utilities.

## Components

- [Prose Layout System](/docs/prose-layout-system/) - Prose-focused layout system for optimal reading experience with proper
line lengths based on typography research (60-75 characters). Uses CSS Grid with
responsive content columns for sidebars, accents, and featured content.
Inspired by fine-art typography and classical book design principles.
- [Grid System](/docs/grid-system/) - 12-column Swiss-style responsive grid with flexible gaps and alignment.
Uses CSS Grid with logical properties for RTL support. Supports nested grids,
asymmetric layouts, gap variants (tight/normal/wide), and responsive column changes.
All gaps align to the vertical rhythm system.
- [Vertical Rhythm System](/docs/vertical-rhythm-system/) - Enhanced bulletproof rhythm system that prevents margin collapse
and ensures consistent vertical spacing throughout the document. Based on the
1rlh (relative line height) rhythm unit for mathematical precision.
Applied globally to <html> root for cascade throughout the page.
Supports responsive rhythm adjustments and granular control per element.
