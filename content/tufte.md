# Tufte Layout System

Create **asymmetrical layouts** with margin notes, sidenotes, and full-bleed figures inspired by Edward Tufte's revolutionary information design philosophy.

## Philosophy

In 1983, Edward Tufte published *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* and challenged a fundamental assumption of modern typography: that margins are wasted space. While Swiss grids treated margins as protective barriers, Tufte saw them as **active reading territory**—places where commentary, data, and annotations could enhance understanding without interrupting the main narrative.

This wasn't new. Medieval scribes filled margins with glosses. Talmudic scholars surrounded core text with concentric rings of commentary. Renaissance printers used marginalia to create layered reading experiences. Tufte brought this 500-year-old tradition into modern design.

**The key insight:** Reading is linear, but understanding is spatial. Sidenotes let readers maintain their place while exploring tangents.
